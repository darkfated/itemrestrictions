This addon allows you to limit and customize certain game items for your server

**Opportunities:**
- Choose which entities and sweps to prohibit and restrict for a particular usergroup
- Remove access to tools (with their removal from the SpawnMenu list)
- And much more in the future!

Console command to open the menu: `itemrestrictions_menu`
